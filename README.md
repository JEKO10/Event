## Project task

The project is about basketball, one of my biggest passions, apart from programming. Created in React/Sass/Typescript, you can learn more about NBA teams, players, and games. You can read the news and make your team.

Website for my municipality for my reference, progress and multi platform development. Website is about upcoming science event in my town.

## Project overview

There is a lot of pages and information about this event and its organization. For example AuthorInfo, Committees, SingleNew, SinglePage, SingleWork, Topics, etc. I added Jest for testing my React components and pages. I plan to create archive for them, because they will host event next year as well. I have created tests for every component and page.
