## Project task

Website for my municipality for my reference, progress, and multi-platform development. The website is about upcoming science events in my town.

## Project overview

There are many pages and information about this event and its organizationâ€”for example, AuthorInfo, Committees, SingleNew, SinglePage, SingleWork, Topics, etc. I added Jest for testing my React components and pages. I plan to create an archive for them because they will host the event next year as well. I have created tests for every component and page.
