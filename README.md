Website for my municipality for my reference, progress and multi platform development. Website is about upcoming science event in my town. There is a lot of pages and information about this event and its organization. For example AuthorInfo, Committees, SingleNew, SinglePage, SingleWork, Topics, etc.

I added Jest for testing my React components and pages.

I plan to create archive for them, because they will host event next year as well.

I have created tests for every component and page.
